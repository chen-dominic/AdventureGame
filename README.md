# AdventureGame (RPG)
(WIP) This is my first proper game I've created and it uses only the classes in the Java System Library.

(No title yet) is an adventure game where you can choose classes and explore the map to defeat monsters and gain experience. Once the game is finished,
there will be more features and entities in the game (monsters, breaking tiles), and there will also include dungeons and bosses.

As of right now, the game only allows player to attack monsters and interact with one NPC.

CONTROLS:
WASD, movement keys |
SPACE, to select (in title screen) |
F, to interact (NPCs, Water Pool Healing) |
K, to attack |
C, to see character stats |
ESC, to pause |
